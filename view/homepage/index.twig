<p>Hello,</p>
<p>read about the web site in the "About site" section. Here I'll just drop some basic info about me cause nothing else to dump right now :)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Born in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Klaipeda,+Lithuania&aq=t&sll=55.378051,-3.435973&sspn=73.4601,162.597656&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Klaip%C4%97da,+Klaipeda+Region,+Lithuania&ll=55.710866,21.131516&spn=0.274265,0.635147&t=m&z=11&vpsrc=0&iwloc=A" target="_blank">Klaipėda</a> (Lithuania)</li>
    <li>All childhood spent in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Palanga,+Lithuania&aq=t&sll=55.710866,21.131516&sspn=0.274265,0.635147&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Palanga,+Klaipeda+Region,+Lithuania&t=m&z=10&iwloc=A&sa=X" target="_blank">Palanga</a> (near Klaipėda) where I finished school</li>
    <li>After school moved to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Vilnius,+Lithuania&aq=t&sll=55.918339,21.067648&sspn=0.545611,1.270294&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Vilnius+district+municipality,+Vilnius+Region,+Lithuania&t=m&z=10&iwloc=A&sa=X" target="_blank">Vilnius</a> to study where finished maths and continued to live there up till fist quarter of 2011</li>
    <li>Moved to the United Kingdom with interesting job offer</li>
    <li>Now I'm working at <a href="http://www.quidco.com/user/1920998/" target="_blank">Quidco</a></li>
</ul>
{#<p class="bold">What I am doing right now for past few months?</p>
<p>Why months? I think it's a reasonable period, 'cause I don't code constantly/everytime. Strange how London eat's up quite a significant amount of hours. Especially when I like to sleep in mornings</p>
<p>So what am I up for? Well, have some plans. Mostly, I think that implies very much nowadays, work gonna be done with jQuery. I do want to train my mind to make HTML more re-usable with templating libraries. Tough when you don't know all elements of pages (when I see the 'tree of life' in DOM for a simple block it makes me 'cry'). But basically I try to make it look simple (as you can see in this web site)</p>
<p>PHP ideas I reckon are really not relevant</p>
<p>Friend of mine mentioned together we could lay our fingers on some Python ideas, or more. That would be nice</p>#}
